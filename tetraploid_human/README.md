# Tetraploid Human

## Data generation

A tetraploid version of human chromosome 1 is generated by merging real and simulated sequencing reads from human samples HG00514 and NA19240. Sequencing reads and phasings from HGSVC are used.

1. Download HGSVC BAM and VCF files with sequencing reads and phasings, and the corresponding reference genome from TODO.
2. In config-file, set paths to the downloaded files
3. run `` snakemake -s Snakefile-polyploid-genome `` in folder data/

## Evaluation

The previously generated tetraploid data sets are phased using whatshap polyphase and hpop, and phasing statistics are computed.

1. Install whatshap polyphase and hpop and update paths in configfile.
2. run `` snakemake -s Snakefile-evaluation `` in folder evaluation/
